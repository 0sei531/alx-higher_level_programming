 Security testing is a critical aspect of the software development life cycle that focuses on identifying and addressing potential security vulnerabilities and flaws. Your list of aspects that security testing should ensure covers various dimensions of security, and the specific vulnerabilities mentioned are common areas of concern. Here's a breakdown of some key points:

Main Aspects of Security Testing:

Confidentiality: Ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized individuals or systems.
Integrity: Verifying that data remains unchanged and reliable throughout its lifecycle.
Authentication: Confirming the identity of users or systems attempting to access the software.
Availability: Ensuring that the system and its resources are accessible and usable when needed.
Authorization: Determining the permissions and access levels granted to authenticated users.
Non-repudiation: Ensuring that actions or transactions cannot be denied by the parties involved.
Secure Against Known and Unknown Vulnerabilities:

Testing for both known vulnerabilities (for which patches or solutions may exist) and unknown vulnerabilities to enhance the software's overall security posture.
Data Security:

Ensuring the protection of data, both in transit and at rest, from unauthorized access or modification.
Compliance with Security Regulations:

Verifying that the software complies with relevant security regulations and standards.
Common Security Vulnerabilities Checked:

Input Checking and Validation: Assessing how the software handles user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection attacks and injection flaws.
Session Management Issues: Ensuring secure and robust session handling to prevent unauthorized access.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks: Identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities related to injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
Buffer Overflows Vulnerabilities: Detecting potential vulnerabilities related to buffer overflows that could be exploited by attackers.
Directory Traversal Attacks: Checking for vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to access files and directories beyond the intended scope.
Security testing is crucial for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a software application. By proactively identifying and addressing security issues, organizations can enhance their software's resilience against potential cyber threats and ensure a more secure computing environment.
